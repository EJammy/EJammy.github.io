It&amp;rsquo;s 12 am and I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll try to reflect on this project a bit, both for myself but also maybe it will help someone. And I may just be trying brag a bit &lt;del>so if any recruiter sees this, please hire me&lt;/del>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, 161 is the Berkeley computer security and my favorite class so far. In the &lt;a href="https://fa23.cs161.org/proj2">second project&lt;/a>, you build a &amp;ldquo;secure file storage system.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the most open-ended project in Berkeley. After the deadline, the autograder will test your solution for weakness. As such, this is not one of the project where most people get full credit or close to full credit. The distribution looks more like &lt;a href="https://assets.cs161.org/proj2/proj2-spec-sp23-distribution.png">this&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
