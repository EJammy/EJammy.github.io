Some Ideas:

- Showoff

## Testing
```c++
int main() {
	return 0;
}
```

## Math
Some equations:

$$

## About my last blog
It was a mess. I basically wrote a bunch of rant 2:00 am stress out about applying to college... and it was in two languages, concurrently. So I just started a new one! I'll probably write some guides and show off some stuff I made. Hopefully it'll be fun :D
